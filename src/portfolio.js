    description: "I hustle harder than I did yesterday.\n\nI’ve always been a creator. As a quiet child, I spent hours with coloring pencils, origami paper, and play dough, fascinated by the idea of turning imagination into something real. That same curiosity later led me to discover programming—and I was instantly hooked.\n\nToday, I’m a web developer with a strong passion for front-end development. I love crafting clean, intuitive user experiences, whether it’s a simple single-page website or a complex web application.\n\nWanting to understand how everything fits together, I grew into full-stack development, learning the complete journey of building, scaling, and deploying web applications. Through internships and hands-on projects, I’ve worked on real-world problems and built solutions that create real impact.\n\nI’m constantly learning, building, and pushing myself to be better than yesterday."
